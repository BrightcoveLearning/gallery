  <h1>Using a Lead Form with a Portal Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to configure an Audience lead form for use in a Portal Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Lead forms can be used to capture viewer information as viewers watch videos and can be used with the following types of experiences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable">Portal</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Live Event Portal</li>
      <li class="language-editable">Landing Page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With Portal, Live Event Portal and some Landing Page experiences, lead forms will be displayed inside the player. Lead forms can be configured to display after a specified number of videos have been viewed or after a predetermined time interval has passed. The following is an example of a lead form displayed inside of a player:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13702-sample-lead-form.png" /></figure>
    <p>Landing Page experiences can also be configured to display a lead form on the body of the page, for example:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="sample lead form" src="/assets/images/experiences/portal/node13702-landing-page-lead-form.png" /></figure>
    <p>Lead data can be downloaded in comma separated or Excel file formats.</p>
    <p>The steps to use a lead form are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable"><a href="#create">Create a lead form using the Audience module</a></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><a href="#assign">Assign the lead form to an Audience-enabled player</a></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><a href="#configure">Configure an experience to use the lead form</a></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><a href="#export">Export the lead data</a></li>
    </ul>
