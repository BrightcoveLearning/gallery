  <h1>Working with Static Content</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to add static content to a Virtual Event Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Static text objects are used to inject custom HTML into the template. This sample hero banner was constructed using a combination of text and images and injected into the top of the page.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>Static content can be any HTML and can be injected anywhere in the template. Static content objects are added to the <code>static_content</code> object in  the configuration file</p>
    <p>The Virtual Event template has four main areas where videos are displayed as designated in the sample site:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Featured collection</li>
      <li>Primary collection</li>
      <li>Secondary collection</li>
      <li>Tracks</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When ordering collections in Gallery, the collections should be ordered in the following manner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collection 1 - Featured collection</li>
      <li>Collection 2 - Secondary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 3 - Primary collection</li>
      <li>Collection 4 - Tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the above example, the collections would be created as follows:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-order-example.png" /></figure>
    <p>Some additional steps are required to configured the tracks. Tracks are covered in the <a href="#tracks">Configuring event tracks</a> section below. When adding videos to collections, Brightcove recommends using <strong>Custom</strong> criteria and then selecting the field and value to use. Brightcove doesn't recommend using the <strong>Playlist</strong> criteria option. This is especially important if you will be using role-based access control.</p>

    <h2 id="tracks">Configuring event tracks</h2>
    <p>When creating the tracks, follow the guidelines below to make sure they appear correctly in the experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tracks collection should be the fourth collection</li>
      <li>The collection name will appear in the virtual event template so use a meaningful name
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-ui-sample.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>The tracks collection will be a nested collection, no videos will appear in this collection</li>
      <li>Create child collections under the tracks collection for each track
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/virtual-event/collection-tracks-example.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Assign videos to the child collections, remember, do not use playlists when creating the collections</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="track-url">Configuring the tracks URL</h2>
    <p>Once the collections have been created, the configuration file needs to be updated so that the On-Demand Sessions link in the header will direct to the correct URL. The name used for the tracks collection (collection 4) will be used in the URL to access the tracks page. To ensure the URL is set correctly, confirm the following.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Review the configuration file and locate the <code>breakout_collection</code> object.</li>
      <li> The <code>collection</code> parameter contains the URL of the tracks page. For example:<br/>
        <pre><code>
"breakout_collection": {
    "collection": "/category/videos/tracks",
    "insert_target": ".bc-on-demand-section",
    "insert_mode": "after"
},
          </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>The last path in the <code>collection</code> URL should reflect the name of your tracks collection (collection 4). For example, if your tracks collection (collection 4) is named Sessions, the collection parameter would be updated to:<br/>
        <pre><code>
"collection": "/category/videos/sessions",      
          </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>To verify the configuration, click the On-Demand Sessions link in the header. The tracks session should appear. Clicking on a track should open the videos in a track. If you see a 404 error, there is a configuration issue.</li>
    </ol>
