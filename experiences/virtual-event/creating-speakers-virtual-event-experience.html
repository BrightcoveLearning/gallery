    <p>Typically, the event agenda  is initially created in a  third-party tool, for example, Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.  The Agenda module requires that  an external .csv agenda file is uploaded to initially create the event agenga. Once the speakers file is uploaded, it can be edited using the Agenda module.</p>

    <p>When creating the initial speakers file, you can download a sample speakers template and edit it or use an existing speakers file you may have created. The Agenda module looks for the existence of specific column names. These columns will be mapped to the appropriate fields in the agenda module. Other columns that may be in your agenda file will be ignored by the agenda module. In order to upload an agenda file, the following columns are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">first_name</code> - Speaker first name</li>
      <li><code translate="No">last_name</code> - Speaker last name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following columns are optional, but if they exist in your speakers file, they will also be imported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">id</code> - Cannot be user defined. This is the ID that would be populated if the user exported a list of speakers as a CSV. This is used to update existing entries in the database.</li>
      <li><code translate="No">email</code> - Speaker  email address</li>
      <li><code translate="No">title</code> - Speaker title</li>
      <li><code translate="No">company</code> - Speaker company</li>
      <li><code translate="No">bio</code> - Speaker bio</li>
      <li><code translate="No">image</code> - Speaker image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you are ready to import your speakers into the Agenda module, export it as a .csv file. <strong>The Agenda module can only import a .csv file.</strong> For information on how to upload your agenda file into the Agenda module, see <a href="managing-agenda-virtual-event-experience.html">Uploading and Customizing the Event Agenda</a>.</p>
