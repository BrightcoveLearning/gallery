  <summary>In this topic you will learn about creating a Virtual Event  Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Gallery provides a Virtual Event  template which can be used to create Virtual Event  Experiences for hosting and delivering virtual events. After creating a new Virtual Event  Experience, you will be prompted to pre-populate the experience. Brightcove recommends choosing <strong>No thanks</strong>.</p>

    <p>The process to add videos to the experience is  similar to other Gallery Portal Experiences although the Virtual Event template does expect the collections to be organized in a specific way.

    <h2 id="config">Adding the configuration file to the template</h2>
    <p>The Virtual Event Portal Experience requires a configuration file be included with the site. The configuration file is added to the template as part of the experience header and controls some of the general template options and is  used to configure and customize several sections of the site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/pages-to-delete/configuring-event-agenda-virtual-event-experience.html">Event schedule</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/pages-to-delete/customizing-speakers-virtual-event-experience.html">Speakers</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-sponsors-virtual-event-experience.html">Sponsors</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p> Brightcove recommends adding the configuration file right after creating a new Virtual Event Portal Experience. For information, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/adding-config-virtual-event-experience.html">Adding the Configuration File to the Experience</a>.</p>
