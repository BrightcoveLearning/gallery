  <summary>In this topic you will learn about creating a Virtual Event  Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Gallery provides a Virtual Event  template which can be used to create Virtual Event  Experiences for hosting and delivering virtual events. After creating a new Virtual Event  Experience, you will be prompted to pre-populate the experience. Brightcove recommends choosing <strong>No thanks</strong>.</p>

    <p>Much of the experience customization is done using a configuration file. The configuration file is added to the template as part of the experience header. After creating a new Virtual Event Portal Experience, the first thing that should be done is to <a href="#config">add the configuration file to the template</a>. </p>
    <p>The configuration file controls some of the general template options and is also used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#header">Customize the header</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-footer-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the footer</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/configuring-event-schedule-virtual-event-experience.html">Configure the event schedule</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-speakers-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the event speakers</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-sponsors-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the event sponsors</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The process to add videos to the experience is  similar to other Gallery Portal Experiences although the Virtual Event template does expect the collections to be organized in a specific way. For information, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/organizing-video-collections.html">Organizing Video Collections in a Virtual Event Experience</a>.</p>
