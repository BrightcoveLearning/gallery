  <h1>Creating a Virtual Event  Experience</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn about creating a Virtual Event  Experience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Gallery provides a Virtual Event Portal template which can be used to create Virtual Event  Experiences for hosting and delivering virtual events. After creating a new Virtual Event  Experience, you will be prompted to pre-populate the experience. Brightcove recommends choosing <strong>No thanks</strong>.</p>

    <p>Much of the experience customization is done using a configuration file. The configuration file is added to the template as part of the experience header. After creating a new Virtual Event Portal Experience, the first thing that should be done is to <a href="#config">add the configuration file to the template</a>. </p>
    <p>The configuration file controls some of the general template options and is also used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#header">Customize the header</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-footer-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the footer</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/configuring-event-schedule-virtual-event-experience.html">Configure the event schedule</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-speakers-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the event speakers</a></li>
      <li><a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-sponsors-virtual-event-experience.html">Customize the event sponsors</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The process to add videos to the experience is  similar to other Gallery Portal Experiences although the Virtual Event template does expect the collections to be organized in a specific way. For information on adding videos, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/adding-videos-virtual-event-experience.html">Adding Videos to a Virtual Event Experience</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="config">Adding the configuration file to the template</h2>
    <p>The Virtual Event Portal Experience requires a configuration file be included with the template. The configuration file includes  site settings, layout options, event schedule, speaers and other content that will be displayed. After creating a new Virtual Event Experience, adding the config file is the first thing that should be done. For information on how to add the configuration file, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/adding-config-virtual-event-experience.html">Adding the Configuration File to the Template</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="header">Configuring the header</h2>
    <p>The header displays at the top of all the pages and provides a way to brand and add social icons to the site. For more information on configuring the header, see <a href="/experiences/virtual-event/customizing-header-virtual-event-experience.html">Customizing the Header for a Virtual Event Experience</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="header2">Configuring the footer</h2>
    <p>The footer displays at the bottom of all the pages and provides a way to brand and add social icons and links to the site. For more information on configuring the footer, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-pre-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Configuring the Footer for a Virtual Event Experience</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="post">Creating the post-event state</h2>
    <p>The post-event state is when the live event has finished. The goal of the post-event state is to encourage site visitors to engage more with the brand, provide an on demand version of the live event and provide links to related content.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating the post-event state, see <a href="/experiences/live/creating-post-event-state-portal-event-experience.html">Creating the Post-Event State for a Portal Event Experience</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="setstate">Setting the home page state</h2>
    <p>Once the pre-, live and post-event state pages have been created, the Gallery site can be configured so the home page displays the appropriate state. To change the home page state, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit the Live Event Portal Experience.</li>
      <li>The current home page state will be displayed in the left navigation.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-homepage-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Change</strong>. The Change Home Page dialog will open.</li>
      <li>Select a home page state and then click <strong>Change</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/experiences/live/node15690-select-state.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The experience MUST be republished after the home page state is changed. Note that it may take a couple of minutes for the state change to be reflected on the live site.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You, the publisher, are responsible for changing the home page state. Gallery will never automatically switch the home page  state.</aside>
