    <h2 id="details">Configuring the site details</h2>

    <p>The following settings can be configured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Use site description in search engine results and when site is shared</strong> - When checked, will use the site description in the &lt;meta&gt; description tags, including the Facebook and Twitter meta tags. If not checked, the description for the featured video is used.</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Site Image</strong> - This is the image that will be shown when the home page of a portal site is shared on Facebook or Twitter.</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Keywords</strong> - Meta keywords that will be added to all site pages. Adding "birds,animals,fish, animal world" will result in the following being added to the page HTML:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="keywords" content="birds,animals,fish,animal world"&gt;</code></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Used to add additional meta tags for the site. These tags will be added to all site pages. Example:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="myCustomTag" content="myCustomValue"&gt;</code></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Include custom video fields in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add custom fields as meta tags. For example, a custom field of <strong>year</strong> with a value of <strong>2018</strong> will add:<br />
        <code>&lt;meta name="year" content="2018"&gt;</code></li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Include canonical URL in page metadata</strong> - When checked, will add a <code><strong>rel=canonical</strong></code> meta tag in the source which helps improve SEO. This is a feature that tells Google to treat all the pages with the same <code>rel=canonical</code> link as a single entry. For example, mysite.com/video/mypage.html is the same as mysite.com/video/mypage.html?username=foobar.</li>
      <li class="language-editable"><strong>Remove video titles from their URLs</strong> - When checked, the video name will not be included as part of the URL to the video detail page, just the video ID will be in the URL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sitemap">Viewing the site map &amp; search feed</h2>
    <p>The Site Map settings display the URLs for the site map and search feed. The site map can be downloaded and submitted to search engines. The search feed can be used by most search engine software as a way to add Gallery content to search results. To access the Search Engine Optimization settings, edit the experience and click <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Search Engine Optimization</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <p>To include the video tags in the site map, check the <strong>Include video tags in site map</strong> option. Note that only the first 32 tags are included. Adding tags to the site map exposes them to search engine web crawlers allowing visitors to find videos based on the video tags.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: These URLs will not be available until the site is published.</aside>

    <p>Site maps are cached for 24 hours. After 24 hours, they are removed from the cache and will be re-generated when they are accessed again. If videos are added to a portal experience, they will not be included in the site map until the site map is re-generated (after 24 hours) or until the site is republished.</p>
