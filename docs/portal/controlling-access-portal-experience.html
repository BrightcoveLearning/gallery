  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to restrict access to a Portal experience using access control profiles.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Access Control Profiles are used to control access to Portal experiences. Access Control Profiles are created as part of the Gallery settings and can restrict access to a site by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limiting access based upon IP address</li>
      <li>Requiring the user to enter credentials (SSO)</li>
      <li>Requiring the user to enter an access code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information on creating Access Control Profiles, see <a href="/docs/settings/configuring-access-control-profiles.html">Configuring Access Control Profiles</a>. Once profiles have been created, they can be assigned to portal experiences to control access. To assign an Access Control Profile to a site, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Edit your Portal experience.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>SITE CONFIGURATION &gt; Access Control</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Select an access control profile for the site. By default, all sites are public.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure you republish the site after making any changes to the access control settings.</p>
